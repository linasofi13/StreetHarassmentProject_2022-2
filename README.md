# Third Delivery Update 
## Code 
* Program can now receive custom coordinates and verify if the given coords are in the dataframe of the streets of Medell√≠n.
  - Check out `customizeCoords()` at the "backmethods" file.
* Program shows 3 paths by redefining the variable v in 3 different ways with Dijkstra's Algorithm.
  - Red path: `v = l * r`
  - Green path: `v = l**(2*r)`
  - Purple path: `v = l + (80r)`
* Added `getDistanceOfPath()` at the "backmethods" file which give us the total length and average risk of a path.
  - Function is being called 3 times to see all the results for each path. 

### Technical Report and Slides

Both technical report and for this delivery have been added to the third delivery folder

## How does this Proyect work ?

Code files are divided in 3 files: 

* [backmethods.py](https://github.com/linasofi13/StreetHarassmentProyect_2022-2/blob/master/codigo/backmethods.py)

  - This file contains all the methods we call in the main file, some of them are:

`generateGraph()`
`getCoords()`
`dijkstraShortestSafest()`

* [main.py](https://github.com/linasofi13/StreetHarassmentProyect_2022-2/blob/master/codigo/main.py)

  - This is the executable file, here we have the main menu inside an infinite loop, which offers us different places to test the algorithm
  or we can just add the coords that we want to test. You can also quit the program by entering the specific option in the menu. 
  - We keep calling functions from backmethods.py. and path_map.py.

* [path_map.py](https://github.com/linasofi13/StreetHarassmentProyect_2022-2/blob/master/codigo/path_map.py)

  - This is our file to draw. We use "Folium", a really nice library to draw the 3 paths requested and we added cute markers to the starting point and the destination.

## Contributors

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification and is brought to you by these [awesome contributors](./CONTRIBUTORS.md).

## Build Process

- Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code. **A Mac is required if you wish to develop for iOS.**
- Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
- `yarn start:ios` to start the packager and run the app in the iOS simulator (`yarn start:ios:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](<https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger>))
- `yarn start:android` to start the packager and run the app in the the Android device/emulator (`yarn start:android:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))

Please take a look at the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed process on how to build your application as well as troubleshooting information.

**Development Keys**: The `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `api/index.js` are for development purposes and do not represent the actual application keys. Feel free to use them or use a new set of keys by creating an [OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) of your own. Set the "Authorization callback URL" to `gitpoint://welcome`.
